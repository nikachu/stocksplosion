# stocksplosion
mini stock app with angularjs

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Stocksplosion app is based on AngularJS and references the following components:

<ul>
<li>angular-chart</li>
<li>chart.js</li>
<li>angular-route</li>
</ul>

It also references jquery, and twitter bootstrap.

<h2>Browser support</h2>
AngularJS projects are by default supported by the latest versions of all standard browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE 9 and up but may require additional tweaks for IE7 and IE8. See http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/ie. 

<h2>How to run the app locally</h2>
AngularJS requires a webserver to run on a local machine. Node.js offers a tool called <code>http-server</code> which can be downloaded from
http://nodejs.org

<h2>Deploy to production</h2>
To run the Stocksplosion app in production, copy the app folder to the production server. It will be available at http://your_server_path/app/

<h2>Unit Tests</h2>
Unit tests are currently in development. Yes I know. But better late than never :)

<h2>App config</h2>
There is a config section at the top of app/view1/view1.js where you can set error messages and date ranges without having to plough through the actual app code.
