# stocksplosion
mini stock app with angularjs

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Stocksplosion app is based on angular-seed, one of the most popular starter apps for AngularJS development. Angular-seed comes with its own local webserver, as well as testing tool running Jasmine and Karma.

In addition to AngularJS, this project references the following components:

<ul>
<li>angular-chart</li>
<li>chart.js</li>
<li>angular-route</li>
</ul>

It also references jquery, and twitter bootstrap.

<h2>Browser support</h2>
Projects based on angular-seed are by default supported by the latest versions of all standard browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE 9 and up but may require additional tweaks for IE7 and IE8. See http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/ie. 

<h2>How to run the app locally</h2>
As the Stocksplosion app is based on angular-seed, you need to install node.js and its package manager npm on your local machine. As mentioned above, the project comes with its own local webserver, a node.js tool called <code>http-server</code>. To start the server, run <code>npm start</code> in the Stocksplosion project directory.

<h2>Deploy to production</h2>
To run the Stocksplosion app in production, copy the app folder to the production server. It will be available at http://your_server_path/app/

<h2>Unit Tests <small>(excerpt from https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/blob/master/README.md)</small></h2>
“The angular-seed app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in Jasmine, which we run with the Karma Test Runner. We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.
<ul>
<li>the configuration is found at karma.conf.js</li>
<li>the unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and are named as ..._test.js.</li>
<li>The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:</li>

<li><code>npm test</code></li>
</ul>


This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will sit and watch the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them change. This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.”
