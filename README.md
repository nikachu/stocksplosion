# stocksplosion
mini stock app with angularjs

Overview
The Stocksplosion app is based on angular-seed, one of the most popular starter apps for AngularJS development. Angular-seed comes with its own local webserver, as well as testing tool running Jasmine and Karma.

In addition to AngularJS, this project references the following components:
angular-chart
chart.js
angular-route

It also references jquery, and twitter bootstrap.

Browser support
Projects based on angular-seed are by default supported by the latest versions of all standard browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE 9 and up but may require additional tweaks for IE7 and IE8. See http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/ie. 

How to run the app locally
As the Stocksplosion app is based on angular-seed, you need to install node.js and its package manager npm on your local machine. As mentioned above, the project comes with its own local webserver, a node.js tool called http-server. To start the server, run npm start in the Stocksplosion project directory.
http://nodejs.org

Deploy to production
To run the Stocksplosion app in production, copy the app folder to the production server. It will be available at http://your_server_path/app/

Unit Tests (excerpt from https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/blob/master/README.md)
“The angular-seed app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in Jasmine, which we run with the Karma Test Runner. We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.
the configuration is found at karma.conf.js
the unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and are named as ..._test.js.
The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:
npm test


This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will sit and watch the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them change. This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.”
